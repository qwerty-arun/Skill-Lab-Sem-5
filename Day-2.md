# Key Learnings
- How to use simulink support for arduino setup
- Basic idea of elemental blocks from feature dropdown
- Basic experiments like: LED switching at a particular frequency, push button interfacing with LED, ultrasound sensor integration, same integration with additional piezo buzzer.
- Difference between Monitor and Build. Monitor is used when we give real time input just like in the case with ultrasound sensor. Build is for direct program loading into the board.
