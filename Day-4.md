# Advanced Design systems by Keysight Technologies
- Smith Chart tool
- Problems based on impedance matching
- Introduction to G+jB charts.
- Adding shunt/series elements to the circuit of Zs* and Zl
- Choosing no. of elements to be minimum.
- Linecal tool: calculation of width and length of microstrip line
- Using stubs to their advantage
- Concept of conjugate matching
- When circuit is matched: the return loss parameter should be less than -10dB. Typically -40dB is very good.
- Addition of lumped elements or s parameter elements into the schematics.
- Introduction to s-parameters: s11, s12, s21 and s22
